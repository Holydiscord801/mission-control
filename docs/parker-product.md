## Summary: The Product Story

**CoreLine isn't a job tracker. It's a relationship-powered career CRM.**

The job board era trained us to spray applications everywhere. That doesn't work anymore. What works is:
- Knowing the right people
- Staying top-of-mind
- Following up consistently

CoreLine makes all three automatic.

**Core differentiators to hammer:**
1. **Relationships, not just applications** — we're a CRM, not a kanban board
2. **Works where you work** — Chrome extension on LinkedIn, not another tab
3. **AI that saves time** — match scoring cuts through noise
4. **63% cheaper** — Huntr charges $40. We charge $14.95. Do the math.
