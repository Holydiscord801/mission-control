# CoreLine 30-Day Marketing Launch Plan
## Master Document — Compiled from Strategy, Product, and Marketing Teams

**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Teams:** Sage (Strategy), Parker (Product), Max (Marketing)

---

## Executive Summary

CoreLine is launching as a **professional relationship CRM** — not just a job tracker. This positioning opens four distinct market segments and creates a sticky product that people keep using after landing a job (unlike Huntr).

**Core Positioning:**
> "CoreLine is the professional relationship CRM that keeps your network alive—whether you're hunting, building, or staying ready."

**Target Segments:**
1. **Active Job Seekers** — Urgent, recently laid off, need systems
2. **Passive Professionals** — Employed but staying visible to recruiters
3. **Network Builders** — "Empire builders" cultivating relationships long-term
4. **Career Insurance** — Keeping warm with headhunters for when opportunity knocks

**Key Differentiators:**
- 63% cheaper than Huntr ($14.95 vs $40/mo)
- Relationship-first, not application-first
- You keep using it AFTER landing (no churn cliff)
- Works where you work (Chrome extension on LinkedIn)
