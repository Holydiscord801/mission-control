# CoreLine Strategy Document
## Sage | Strategy Lead | 30-Day Launch Plan

---

## 1. Core Positioning Statement

> **"CoreLine is the professional relationship CRM that keeps your network alive—whether you're hunting, building, or staying ready."**

**Why this works:**
- "Professional relationship CRM" — elevates beyond job tracker
- "Keeps your network alive" — implies ongoing value, not one-time use
- "Hunting, building, or staying ready" — speaks to all four segments
- No mention of "job search" as primary identity

**Alternative taglines for testing:**
- "Your career never sleeps. Neither should your network."
- "Land the job. Keep the relationships."
- "From job search to career insurance."

---

## 2. Messaging Framework by Segment

### Segment A: Active Job Seekers (The Urgent)
**Psychographic:** Recently laid off, stressed, applying everywhere, overwhelmed by spreadsheets and tabs

| Element | Message |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain Point** | "I'm applying to 50+ jobs and losing track of who said what, when to follow up, and which contacts might help." |
| **Emotional Trigger** | Anxiety, overwhelm, fear of missing opportunities |
| **Promise** | "Never lose track of a lead, follow-up, or warm intro again." |
| **Proof Point** | Follow-up reminders have been shown to increase response rates by 40%+ |
| **CTA Style** | Urgency-driven: "Start organizing your search today—free trial" |

**Key messages:**
- Track applications, contacts, and follow-ups in one place
- Smart reminders so nothing falls through the cracks
- See your whole job search at a glance
- Less than half the cost of Huntr ($14.95 vs $40)

---

### Segment B: Passive Professionals (The Quietly Open)
**Psychographic:** Employed but keeping options open, want to stay on recruiters' radars, don't want to look desperate

| Element | Message |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain Point** | "I'm not actively looking, but I don't want to be invisible when the right opportunity comes." |
| **Emotional Trigger** | FOMO, career anxiety, desire for control |
| **Promise** | "Stay visible to the right people without the awkward hustle." |
| **Proof Point** | 70% of jobs are filled through networking, not applications |
| **CTA Style** | Low-pressure: "Keep your network warm—5 min/week" |

**Key messages:**
- Maintain recruiter relationships without active job hunting
- Get reminders to check in with key contacts
- Be the first call when opportunities open
- Career insurance that runs quietly in the background

---

### Segment C: Network/Empire Builders (The Ambitious)
**Psychographic:** Entrepreneurs, consultants, sales pros, anyone who knows relationships = opportunities

| Element | Message |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain Point** | "I meet so many people but never systematically nurture those relationships." |
| **Emotional Trigger** | Ambition, opportunity cost, professional identity |
| **Promise** | "Turn contacts into a compounding professional network." |
| **Proof Point** | Your network is your net worth (and it needs maintenance) |
| **CTA Style** | Investment framing: "Build the network that builds your career" |

**Key messages:**
- Every coffee chat, intro, and connection—captured and nurtured
- Relationship intelligence that compounds over time
- Not a Rolodex—a relationship engine
- The CRM for people who know relationships matter

---

### Segment D: Career Insurance Crowd (The Prepared)
**Psychographic:** Employed, not looking, but want to never be caught off-guard by layoffs again

| Element | Message |
|---------|---------|
| **Pain Point** | "Last time I got laid off, I had to rebuild my network from scratch. Never again." |
| **Emotional Trigger** | Fear, preparedness, control |
| **Promise** | "Be ready before you need to be." |
| **Proof Point** | Average job search after layoff: 5-6 months. With maintained network: significantly faster |
| **CTA Style** | Insurance framing: "Career insurance for $14.95/month" |

**Key messages:**
- Keep headhunter relationships warm even when employed
- One-click reactivation when you need your network
- Never start from zero again
- The safety net that costs less than a lunch

---

## 3. Competitive Differentiation

### CoreLine vs. Huntr ($40/mo)

| Dimension | Huntr | CoreLine |
|-----------|-------|----------|
| **Price** | $40/month | $14.95/month (63% less) |
| **Focus** | Job applications | Professional relationships |
| **Lifecycle** | Cancel after landing | Keep using for career |
| **Value Prop** | Track your search | Build your network |
| **Churn Pattern** | High (job = done) | Low (relationships = ongoing) |

**Competitive messaging:**
- "All the job tracking, plus the relationships that actually get you hired—at a third of the price."
- "Huntr helps you apply. CoreLine helps you get introduced."
- "Why pay $40/mo for something you'll cancel in 3 months?"

---

### CoreLine vs. Spreadsheets (Free)

| Dimension | Spreadsheets | CoreLine |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| **Price** | Free | $14.95/month |
| **Reminders** | None (manual) | Automated |
| **Relationship context** | Scattered notes | Unified history |
| **Mobile access** | Clunky | Native |
| **Time investment** | High maintenance | Low maintenance |
| **Abandonment** | 90% stop updating within 2 weeks | Designed for consistency |

**Competitive messaging:**
- "Spreadsheets don't remind you to follow up."
- "Free isn't free when it costs you opportunities."
- "Your career is worth more than a spreadsheet."

---

### CoreLine vs. Doing Nothing

| Consequence | Reality |
|-------------|---------|
| Missed follow-ups | 80% of opportunities require 5+ touchpoints |
| Cold network | Warm intros are 10x more likely to land interviews |
| Panic rebuilding | 6-month scramble vs. 6-week activation |
| Lost relationships | People forget. Systems don't. |

**Competitive messaging:**
- "The cost of not staying in touch is invisible—until you need help."
- "You can't withdraw from a network you never invested in."

---

## 4. Founder Story Angle

### The Narrative Arc

**Setup:** Micah had a good job. A good network. Then layoff hit.

**Conflict:** Scrambling to remember who he knew, what they did, when they last talked. Business cards in drawers. LinkedIn connections who were strangers. Spreadsheets that got abandoned after week two.

**Insight:** "I realized I'd been COLLECTING contacts, not CULTIVATING relationships. When I needed my network most, I didn't actually have one."

**Solution:** Built CoreLine from the pain. Not another job tracker—a relationship system that keeps your network alive.

**Credibility hook:** "I built this because I needed it. And I'm still using it—not because I'm job hunting, but because I'm never getting caught off-guard again."

### Story Deployment

| Channel | Format |
|---------|--------|
| Landing page | Hero section + "Our Story" page |
| Launch emails | Personal narrative in founder's voice |
| LinkedIn posts | Thread: "I got laid off. Here's what I learned." |
| Product Hunt | Maker story in comments |
| Twitter/X | Thread with emotional beats |

---

## 5. Objection Handling

### Objection: "Spreadsheets are free"

**Response framework:**

1. **Acknowledge:** "Totally fair. Spreadsheets work—for about two weeks."
2. **Reframe:** "The question isn't cost. It's: will you actually use it?"
3. **Evidence:** "90% of job search spreadsheets are abandoned within 14 days. No reminders. No accountability. No system."
4. **Close:** "CoreLine costs less than one networking coffee per month. And it actually gets used."

**Quick-hit versions:**
- "Spreadsheets don't ping you when it's time to follow up."
- "Free doesn't help when you forget to open it."
- "Your career is worth $14.95/month."

---

### Objection: "I'm not actively job hunting"

**Response:**
"Perfect. Neither are most of our users. CoreLine is career insurance—it keeps your network warm so you're never caught off-guard. Five minutes a week now saves five months of scrambling later."

---

### Objection: "I already use LinkedIn"

**Response:**
"LinkedIn is where connections live. CoreLine is where relationships get nurtured. When's the last time LinkedIn reminded you to check in with a former colleague? To follow up with a recruiter? We're the layer that makes LinkedIn actually work."

---

### Objection: "I'll sign up when I need it"

**Response:**
"That's like buying fire insurance after the fire. The whole point is having a warm network BEFORE you need it. The best time to start was a year ago. The second best time is today."

---

## 6. Social Proof Strategy (Pre-Users)

### Phase 1: Launch Week (No Users Yet)

| Tactic | Execution |
|--------|-----------|
| **Founder credibility** | Micah's story IS the proof. Real pain, real solution. |
| **Beta tester quotes** | Get 5-10 people to use free beta, collect quotes |
| **Expert validation** | Career coaches endorsing the approach |
| **Social signals** | "500 people on the waitlist" / "Backed by X" |
| **Risk reversal** | "30-day money back, no questions" = we're confident |

### Phase 2: Week 2-4 (Early Users)

| Tactic | Execution |
|--------|-----------|
| **Micro-testimonials** | One-sentence quotes with real names |
| **Usage stats** | "327 follow-up reminders sent this week" |
| **Before/after** | "I landed 3 interviews through reconnections I'd forgotten about" |
| **Social sharing** | Prompt users to share their "network wins" |

### Phase 3: Month 2+ (Scaling Proof)

| Tactic | Execution |
|--------|-----------|
| **Case studies** | Full stories with names, outcomes |
| **Logos** | "Professionals from Google, Meta, startups..." |
| **Numbers** | "1,000+ professionals managing their networks" |
| **Community** | Testimonials from community members |

### Quick Win: Beta Program as Proof Engine
- Offer free access to 50 beta users
- Requirements: Must provide feedback + testimonial at 30 days
- Creates instant social proof pipeline

## 7. Launch Offer Recommendation

### Recommended: **Founding Member Pricing**

**Structure:**
- **$9.95/month** (locked for life) for first 100 subscribers
- Regular price: $14.95/month
- Creates urgency + early adopter loyalty

**Why this works:**
- ✅ Creates scarcity (100 spots)
- ✅ Rewards early believers
- ✅ Doesn't devalue the product (it's a reward, not desperation)
- ✅ Locks in long-term users at lower CAC
- ✅ "Founding member" language builds community

### Alternative Options Considered:

| Offer | Pros | Cons |
|-------|------|------|
| **Free trial (14-day)** | Low barrier | Credit card friction, high churn |
| **Freemium** | Growth | Complicates monetization, delays revenue |
| **Discount (30% off)** | Clear value | Feels transactional, not special |
| **Annual discount** | Better LTV | Too much commitment early |

### Launch Sequence:
1. **Week 1:** Waitlist with "Founding Member" positioning
2. **Week 2:** Open to waitlist (first 100 get locked pricing)
3. **Week 3:** Public launch at full price
4. **Week 4:** Consider limited "last chance" for stragglers

## 8. KPIs to Track Success

### North Star Metric
**Active Relationship Managers (ARMs):** Users who log in and take action 2+ times per week

*Why:* This measures real engagement, not vanity signups.

---

### Launch Phase KPIs (Days 1-30)

| Category | Metric | Target | Why It Matters |
|----------|--------|--------|----------------|
| **Acquisition** | Waitlist signups | 500 | Validates demand |
| **Acquisition** | Paid conversions | 100 | Revenue validation |
| **Acquisition** | CAC | <$25 | Sustainable growth |
| **Activation** | Users who add 5+ contacts | 70% | First value moment |
| **Activation** | Day 1 retention | >50% | Product stickiness |
| **Engagement** | Weekly active users | 60% | Habit formation |
| **Revenue** | MRR | $1,000-$1,500 | Business validation |
| **Retention** | 30-day retention | >40% | Product-market fit signal |

---

### Funnel Metrics to Monitor

```

    ↓
Waitlist → Trial/paid start (target: 30% conversion)
    ↓
Start → Add 5+ contacts (target: 70% in first session)
    ↓

    ↓

    ↓
Action → Weekly return (target: 40% weekly active)
```

---

### Leading Indicators (Early Warning Signals)

| Metric | Good Sign | Warning Sign |
|--------|-----------|--------------|
| Time to first contact added | <5 min | >24 hours |
| Reminders set per user | 3+ | 0-1 |
| Day 3 login rate | >40% | <20% |
| Support tickets | Feature requests | Confusion/bugs |
| Social mentions | Organic sharing | Silence |

---

### Qualitative KPIs

- **NPS from early users:** >40 = strong, >60 = exceptional
- **Common feedback themes:** What do people love? What's confusing?
- **Testimonial quality:** Are people willing to go on record?
- **Referral intent:** "Would you recommend this?" Yes rate

---

## Strategic Summary

### The Big Bet
CoreLine wins by being the **relationship layer** on top of job search—the thing that keeps working after you land. This is the churn-killer. This is the moat.

### Key Strategic Moves
1. **Position as relationship CRM, not job tracker**
2. **Price as career insurance** ($14.95/mo = less than a lunch)
3. **Lead with founder story** (authentic, relatable, credible)
4. **Create urgency through scarcity** (Founding Member pricing)
5. **Build proof pipeline from day one** (beta testimonials)

### What We're NOT Doing
- ❌ Competing on features with Huntr
- ❌ Racing to the bottom on price
- ❌ Positioning as "just for job seekers"
- ❌ Free tier (not yet—focus on paid validation)

**Handoff Notes for Max (Marketing) and Parker (Product):**

**Max:** Use the messaging framework for landing page copy, ads, and email sequences. The founder story is your emotional hook—lead with it on social.

**Parker:** The activation metrics matter most. Users who add 5+ contacts and set reminders stick around. Optimize onboarding for those two actions.

Let's launch this thing. 🚀
