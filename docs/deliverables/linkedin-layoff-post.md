# Micah's LinkedIn Layoff Story — DRAFT

## Version A: Raw & Vulnerable (Recommended)

---

I got laid off in November.

After 15+ years building technology teams, leading digital transformations at billion-dollar companies, opening US divisions from scratch...

I was "no longer needed."

The first week, I applied to 47 jobs. The second week, 63 more. By week three, I had lost track of who I'd talked to, which companies I'd applied to, and whose email I was supposed to follow up on.

My "system" was a mess of spreadsheets, sticky notes, and browser tabs I was terrified to close.

So I did what any unemployed engineer would do:

I built something.

What started as a personal tracker turned into something bigger. I realized the problem wasn't just organization — it was that I was treating job hunting like a numbers game instead of a relationship game.

The jobs I got callbacks on? All came through people I knew.
The cold applications? Silence.

So I pivoted. I built a tool that shows you WHO you know at every company you're interested in. That reminds you to follow up with the connections who can actually help. That treats your network like the asset it is.

I'm calling it CoreLine.

It's launching soon. If you're in the job search trenches — or know someone who is — I'd love your feedback.

Drop a comment or DM me. Let's make job searching a little less soul-crushing together.

## Version B: Shorter, Punchier

---

I got laid off after 15 years in tech.

Sent 100+ applications. Crickets.

Then I got 3 interviews in one week. The difference?

Every single one came through someone I knew.

Cold applications: 0 callbacks.
Warm intros: 3 interviews.

The data was clear. So I built a tool to help job seekers leverage their network instead of just spraying resumes into the void.

It shows you who you know at every company.
It reminds you to follow up.
It turns your network into your job search strategy.

Launching soon. DM me if you want early access.

## Version C: Story Arc (Longer Form)

---

17 years old: Got my pilot's license.
25: Youngest manager at a simulation software company.
30: Leading digital transformation at a $2.5B company.
35: Opening US divisions for a $5.6B German company.
40: Laid off.

November 2024 hit me like a brick wall.

I did everything right. Built teams. Delivered results. Got the references.

None of it mattered when the spreadsheet said "cut costs."

The first month was a blur of applications. Indeed. LinkedIn. Company websites. I was treating it like a volume game — more applications = more chances.

100 applications later: 2 automated rejections. That's it.

Then something shifted.

A former colleague mentioned my name to their VP. Interview scheduled in 48 hours.
A LinkedIn connection from 3 years ago saw my "open to work" badge. Coffee chat turned into a referral.
My old boss from 2019 heard I was looking. "Let me make some calls."

Three warm intros did more than 100 cold applications.

That's when I realized: I wasn't playing the right game.

Job searching isn't about volume. It's about relationships.

So I built CoreLine — a tool that helps you see who you know, nurture those relationships, and turn your network into your unfair advantage.

Because your network isn't just nice to have.
It's the whole game.

Launching in February. Comment "EARLY" if you want first access.
