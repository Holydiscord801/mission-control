# CoreLine 30-Day Launch Plan: Channel Execution
**Author:** Max (Marketing Lead)  
**Collaborators:** Sage (Strategy), Parker (Product)  
**Last Updated:** January 2025

---

## Executive Summary

This plan turns CoreLine's launch into a coordinated 30-day campaign across 8 channels. We're not just announcing a product—we're starting a movement around "professional relationship building" that extends beyond job hunting.

**Core Narrative:** "I got laid off and built the tool I wished existed. Then I realized everyone needs it—not just job seekers."

---

## 1. Content Themes by Week

### Week 1: "The Problem" (Days 1-7)
*Build awareness of the pain without selling*

- The chaos of job searching (spreadsheets, lost contacts, forgotten follow-ups)
- "I had 47 tabs open and still missed my dream job callback"
- The hidden cost of weak professional networks
- Why relationships decay without systems

**Goal:** Get heads nodding. Make people feel seen.

### Week 2: "The Journey" (Days 8-14)
*Micah's founder story + early validation*

- The layoff story (raw, honest)
- Building in public moments
- Early user testimonials (even from beta)
- "What I learned tracking 200 professional relationships"

**Goal:** Build emotional connection and credibility.

### Week 3: "The Solution" (Days 15-21)
*Product reveal + differentiation*

- CoreLine introduction (what it does, who it's for)
- Huntr comparison (without being petty—focus on value)
- Use cases beyond job hunting
- Waitlist push intensifies

**Goal:** Convert awareness into signups.

### Week 4: "The Launch" (Days 22-30)
*Full launch blitz*

- Product Hunt launch (Day 25)
- Hacker News post (Day 26)
- Launch day content storm
- Early adopter social proof
- "Empire builder" positioning

**Goal:** Maximum visibility, conversions, and momentum.

---

## 2. Platform-Specific Messaging

### LinkedIn

**Micah's Personal Page (Primary Driver)**

*Voice:* Vulnerable, experienced, thoughtful. First-person stories. No corporate speak.

*Posting Schedule:* 
- Tuesday 8am MT, Thursday 8am MT, Sunday 7pm MT
- (LinkedIn algorithm favors consistency + early morning for professionals)

*Content Mix:*
- 60% Personal stories/lessons (job search, networking, career)
- 25% Building CoreLine in public
- 15% Direct product mentions

**Example Posts:**

**Week 1 - The Problem:**
```
I applied to 127 jobs in 6 weeks after my layoff.

I tracked them in a spreadsheet.
Then a Notion database.
Then a different spreadsheet.

By week 4, I had:
- 3 interviews I almost forgot about
- 2 recruiters I ghosted (accidentally)
- 1 connection who could've referred me—but I lost their email

The tools weren't the problem.
The problem was me trying to duct-tape 5 apps together.

Anyone else feel like job searching requires a PM certification?
```

**Week 2 - The Journey:**
```
3 months ago I got laid off.

I didn't post about it here. I was embarrassed.

Now I'm building the tool I wished existed during that chaos.

It started as a job tracker. But then I realized something:

The relationships I built DURING my job search are more valuable than any single application.

The recruiter who checked in monthly.
The former colleague who sent opportunities.
The stranger who replied to my cold LinkedIn message.

Those relationships didn't end when I stopped job hunting.

So I stopped building a job tracker.

I started building a relationship system.

More soon. 👀
```

**Week 3 - The Solution:**
```
I've been building something.

CoreLine: A CRM for your professional relationships.

Not just for job seekers.
For anyone who knows their network is their net worth—but has no system to prove it.

Track every meaningful connection.
Get reminded before relationships go cold.
See your network as what it is: an asset.

$14.95/month. No free tier that guilts you into upgrading.

Waitlist is open. Link in comments.

(Yes, I know another productivity app. But this one I actually use daily. And I built it.)
```

---

**CoreLine Company Page**

*Voice:* Helpful, clear, slightly playful. "We" language. Educational.

*Posting Schedule:*
- Monday 9am MT, Wednesday 12pm MT, Friday 9am MT

*Content Mix:*
- 40% Tips/educational content
- 30% User stories/testimonials
- 20% Product updates
- 10% Industry news commentary

**Example Posts:**

```
The average professional knows 600+ people.

The average professional actively maintains relationships with... 12.

That gap? That's where opportunities disappear.

CoreLine helps you close it.
```

```
"I use Huntr for job tracking."

Cool. What happens after you land the job?

Huntr: $40/month for a tool you'll abandon.
CoreLine: $14.95/month for a system you'll use forever.

Your network doesn't stop mattering when you get hired.
```

Title: Got laid off 3 months ago. Built the tool I wished existed during my job search. Here's what I learned.

Hey everyone,

Joined this sub when I got the news in October. Lurked a lot. The posts here helped more than any career coach.

Quick backstory: 15 years in tech, thought I was safe, wasn't.

During my search I realized my biggest problem wasn't finding jobs—it was managing the chaos:
- Spreadsheets everywhere
- Forgot to follow up with a recruiter (cost me an interview)
- Lost track of a warm intro that could've been huge

So I started building a tool. Originally just for me.

It's a relationship CRM—tracks your professional network, reminds you to follow up, shows you which connections are going cold.

NOT just for job hunting. I'm still using it now that I'm employed again because the network you build during a search? That's career insurance forever.

Called it CoreLine. Launching next month. If anyone wants early access, DM me—giving free beta access to this community because y'all kept me sane.

Not trying to sell anything here. Just wanted to share in case it helps someone else going through it.

What tools did you wish existed during your search?
```

**Example Post (r/SideProject):**

```
Title: Roast my landing page—relationship CRM for professionals ($14.95/mo)

Shipping CoreLine in 2 weeks. It's a CRM for your professional network.

The pitch: Your network is your biggest career asset but you manage it with... memory and hope?

Differentiator: Most "job trackers" are for active searches. This is for ONGOING relationship management. You don't stop using it when you get hired.

$14.95/mo (competitor Huntr is $40/mo and only does job tracking)

Landing page: [link]

Looking for honest feedback on:
1. Is the value prop clear?
2. Does the pricing feel right?
3. Would you use this? Why/why not?

Thanks in advance. Be brutal.
```

---

### Twitter/X

*Voice:* Punchy, opinionated, slightly provocative. Hot takes welcome.

*Posting Schedule:*
- 2-3 tweets daily (morning, noon, evening MT)
- 1 thread per week
- Quote tweets and replies throughout day

*Content Mix:*
- 40% Hot takes on careers/networking
- 30% Building in public
- 20% Direct CoreLine content
- 10% Engagement with others

**Example Tweets:**

```
unpopular opinion: your LinkedIn connections are worthless if you can't remember why you connected

most people have 500+ connections and actively maintain maybe 10

your network isn't your net worth if you're not actually working it
```

```
job search tools that become useless after you land the job are a scam

you spent 3 months building relationships

then you just... forget them?

that's not a tool. that's a crutch.
```

```
building a CRM for professional relationships

not because the world needs another SaaS

but because I had 200 contacts in a spreadsheet and still managed to forget to follow up with the ONE person who could've gotten me hired faster

anyway, shipping soon
```

**Thread Example:**

```
I got laid off and did what everyone does:

- Updated my resume
- Refreshed LinkedIn
- Applied to 100+ jobs

But here's what actually got me hired (and what I wish I'd focused on from day 1):

🧵👇

1/ I tracked every conversation like a salesperson tracks leads

Not in a creepy way. In a "this person helped me, I should check in next month" way.

2/ I realized my network had decayed

People I hadn't talked to in 2 years? They didn't even remember our project together.

Relationships have a half-life. And I'd let most of mine expire.

3/ I started treating my job search like a relationship business

Every coffee chat → logged
Every helpful reply → followed up
Every referral → thank you note

4/ After I landed? I kept going.

Because the network I built DURING the search is now my career insurance.

Next layoff (and there will be one), I won't start from zero.

5/ This is why I built CoreLine.

Not a job tracker. A relationship system.

Because your network is only an asset if you actually maintain it.

Launching soon. Link in bio.
```

### Product Hunt

**Launch Day: Day 25 (Tuesday)**

*Why Tuesday:* Best day for PH launches (Mon is crowded, Wed-Fri drops off)

**Pre-Launch Checklist (Weeks 1-3):**
- [ ] Create "Coming Soon" page (Week 1)
- [ ] Collect email subscribers (target: 500+)
- [ ] Build hunter network (reach out to top hunters for potential feature)
- [ ] Prepare all assets (logo, screenshots/mockups, video if possible)
- [ ] Write compelling tagline (test 3-5 versions)
- [ ] Draft maker comment for launch day
- [ ] Line up 20+ people to upvote/comment at launch

**Tagline Options:**
1. "A CRM for your professional relationships—not just job hunting"
2. "Your network is your net worth. Finally, a system to prove it."
3. "Track professional relationships like a CRM tracks sales"
4. "The professional relationship manager you'll use after you land the job"

**First Comment (Maker's Story):**

```
Hey PH! 👋

I'm Micah, and I built CoreLine after getting laid off last year.

During my job search, I realized the tools that existed were all about APPLICATIONS—but the thing that actually got me hired was RELATIONSHIPS.

A former colleague's referral. A recruiter who remembered me. A stranger who replied to a cold message.

I tracked them all in a janky spreadsheet. Then I forgot to follow up with half of them.

So I built CoreLine: a CRM for your professional network.

Key differences from tools like Huntr:
✅ Relationship-first, not application-first
✅ You keep using it AFTER landing a job
✅ $14.95/mo (vs $40/mo)
✅ Built for network builders, not just job seekers

Would love your feedback—and if you're in career transition (or just want career insurance), I'd love to help.

AMA! 👇
```

### Hacker News

**Launch Day: Day 26 (Wednesday, following PH)**

*Strategy:* "Show HN" post with technical/founder angle. HN loves authentic builder stories.

**Post Format:**

```
Title: Show HN: CoreLine – I got laid off and built a professional relationship CRM

Body:
I got laid off after 15 years in tech. During my job search, I realized I was terrible at managing professional relationships—not the applications, the people.

I built CoreLine to fix that. It's a CRM for your professional network:
- Track contacts and interaction history
- Get reminders before relationships go cold
- See which connections are decaying
- Works for job seekers AND employed professionals

Stack: [whatever you're using]
Demo: [link]
Pricing: $14.95/mo (competitor Huntr is $40)

The key insight: job search tools that become useless after landing are a bad investment. Your network matters before, during, AND after a search.

Happy to answer technical or product questions. And yes, I know—another productivity SaaS. But this one I actually use daily.
```

**HN-Specific Rules:**
- Don't ask for upvotes (will get flagged)
- Be in comments for the first 2 hours
- Answer technical questions honestly
- Accept criticism gracefully
- Don't be defensive about competition

---

### Job Search Communities

**Facebook Groups (Target 5-10):**
- "Job Search Support Group"
- "Laid Off & Looking"
- "Tech Professionals Job Search"
- Industry-specific groups

*Strategy:* Join groups, be helpful for 2+ weeks, THEN mention tool. Link to free resource first, product second.

**Discord Servers:**
- Career-focused servers
- Tech job hunting servers
- Indie hacker communities

*Strategy:* Same as Facebook—earn trust first. Offer beta access to active members.

**Example Community Post:**

```
Hey everyone 👋

I've been lurking here since I got laid off a few months ago. This group honestly helped me more than any career coach.

I built a tool during my search that I want to share—it's a CRM for managing professional relationships during job hunts (and after).

Not trying to sell anything—giving free access to anyone here who wants it.

DM me if interested. And thanks for being an awesome community. 🙏
```

### Bot Dog Outbound (LinkedIn Automation)

**Tool:** Bot Dog — searches LinkedIn for "Open to Work" badge holders (green ring on profile photo)

**Why This Channel Matters:**
These are hand-raised prospects. They've publicly declared they're job hunting. No guessing about intent—they WANT help. This is the warmest cold outreach you can do.

**Volume Recommendations:**

| Phase | Daily Volume | Weekly Total | Notes |
|-------|-------------|--------------|-------|
| Week 1-2 | 15-20/day | 100-140 | Test messaging, refine |
| Week 3-4 | 25-35/day | 175-245 | Scale what works |
| Post-launch | 40-50/day | 280-350 | Max sustainable volume |

**Why these numbers:**
- LinkedIn flags accounts sending 100+ connection requests/day
- "Open to Work" people get LOTS of messages—quality > quantity
- Better to have 20 thoughtful conversations than 100 ignored blasts
- Split between Micah's account and CoreLine page to double reach

**Segmentation Strategy:**

**Segment A: "Fresh Seekers" (Changed to Open to Work < 2 weeks)**
- Higher urgency, more emotional
- Still optimistic, building systems
- Lead with: "I just went through this..."
- More receptive to tools/resources

**Segment B: "Battle-Worn Seekers" (Open to Work 2+ months)**
- Frustrated, overwhelmed
- Tried everything, skeptical of "solutions"
- Lead with: empathy + specific pain point
- Position as "what finally worked for me"

**Segment C: "Industry-Specific" (Tech, Sales, Marketing, etc.)**
- Customize messaging to their world
- Reference industry-specific chaos
- Use relevant examples

---

#### Message Templates: Micah's Personal Voice

**Initial Connection Request (keep under 300 chars):**

**Template A - Fresh Seekers:**
```
Hey [Name] — saw you're in job search mode. I was in your shoes 3 months ago (15 years in tech, then laid off). Built a tool during my search that actually helped. Happy to share if useful. No pitch, just paying it forward.
```

**Template B - Battle-Worn Seekers:**
```
Hey [Name] — noticed you've been on the hunt for a bit. I know how exhausting it gets. Went through a brutal search myself recently and learned some things the hard way. Happy to share what worked if you're open to it.
```

**Template C - Tech Specific:**
```
Hey [Name] — fellow tech person here, recently went through a layoff after 15 years. The job search chaos was real. Built something to help manage it all. Would love to connect and share if you're interested.
```

**Follow-Up Sequence (After Connection Accepted):**

**Message 1 (Immediate — within 24 hours):**
```
Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

Quick background: I got laid off last year and went through the whole job search grind. Spreadsheets everywhere, forgot to follow up with recruiters, lost track of warm intros.

So I built CoreLine — basically a CRM for managing your job search relationships. Not just tracking applications, but tracking the PEOPLE who can actually help you land something.

Still building it out, but happy to give you early access if you want to try it. No charge — just looking for feedback from people actually in the trenches.

Either way, happy to help however I can. What's been your biggest challenge so far?
```

**Message 2 (Day 3 — if no response):**
```
Hey [Name] — no worries if you're swamped (job searching is a full-time job, I know).

Just wanted to share one thing that helped me: I started treating my job search like a sales pipeline. Every recruiter, every referral, every coffee chat — logged and followed up systematically.

Went from chaos to actually knowing where I stood.

If you ever want to compare notes, I'm around. Good luck out there! 💪
```

**Message 3 (Day 7 — final follow-up):**
```
Last ping, I promise! 

Just wanted to drop this free resource I put together: [link to lead magnet — networking playbook or relationship audit template]

Helped me organize my job search when I was drowning. Hopefully useful for you too.

Rooting for you, [Name]. The right thing will come.
```

No signup required. Hope it helps!

— The CoreLine Team
```

**Message 3 (Day 8 — value drop, no ask):**
```
Quick tip that's helped a lot of job seekers we talk to:

Set a weekly "relationship audit" — 15 minutes every Sunday to review:
• Who did I talk to this week?
• Who should I follow up with?
• Which connections are going cold?

Simple system, huge results.

Wishing you the best, [Name]! 🎯
```

#### Bot Dog Best Practices

**DO:**
- Personalize the first line (mention their industry, role, or something from their profile)
- Keep initial messages SHORT (under 300 chars for connection requests)
- Space out follow-ups (don't rapid-fire)
- Track response rates by template (A/B test constantly)
- Stop messaging after 3 touches with no response
- Respond personally when someone replies (don't automate conversations)

**DON'T:**
- Send identical messages to everyone (LinkedIn detects this)
- Pitch hard in the first message
- Message the same person from both Micah AND CoreLine accounts
- Exceed 50 messages/day per account
- Automate responses to replies (real conversations only)
- Forget to log engaged prospects in CoreLine (eat your own dog food!)

**Metrics to Track:**
- Connection acceptance rate (target: 30%+)
- Response rate to Message 1 (target: 15%+)
- Conversion to trial/signup (target: 5%+)
- Unsubscribe/block rate (keep under 2%)

**Weekly Review:**
Every Friday, review:
1. Which templates performed best?
2. Which segments converted highest?
3. Any negative feedback to address?
4. Adjust messaging for next week

**Avoid:**
- Corporate speak
- Excessive exclamation points
