## 1. Core Marketing Frameworks

### 1.1 AARRR (Pirate Metrics)
The foundational framework for B2C SaaS growth. For job seekers:

| Stage | Definition | Coreline Application |
|-------|------------|---------------------|
| **Acquisition** | How users find you | SEO, LinkedIn, Reddit, career content |
| **Activation** | First "aha moment" | User creates first job board, saves first job |
| **Retention** | Users come back | Daily job tracking, interview reminders, streaks |
| **Referral** | Users invite others | "Share your job hunt progress," referral program |
| **Revenue** | Users pay | Freemium → Premium (AI features, unlimited jobs) |

**Key Insight:** For job seekers, activation is critical. The "aha moment" should happen within the first session—likely when they see their scattered job search finally organized.

### 1.2 Jobs-to-be-Done (JTBD)
Understand WHY job seekers hire your product:

**Primary Job:** "When I'm actively searching for a job, I want to stay organized and not miss opportunities, so I can land my ideal role faster."

**Functional Jobs:**
- Track all my applications in one place
- Remember which jobs I've applied to
- Prepare for upcoming interviews
- Tailor my resume to each job
- Follow up at the right time

**Emotional Jobs:**
- Feel in control during a chaotic time
- Reduce anxiety about the job search
- Feel productive even when not hearing back
- Build confidence before interviews

**Social Jobs:**
- Appear organized to recruiters
- Share progress with accountability partners
- Feel less alone in the job search

### 1.3 Product-Led Growth (PLG)
*Based on Superhuman's PMF Engine (40% "Very Disappointed" Test)*

**Survey your users with:**
1. How would you feel if you could no longer use Coreline? (Very/Somewhat/Not disappointed)
2. What type of people would most benefit from Coreline?
3. What is the main benefit you receive from Coreline?
4. How can we improve Coreline for you?

**Target:** 40%+ "very disappointed" = product-market fit

**Segment Strategy:**
- Focus on users who ARE very disappointed
- Analyze WHY they love it (speed? organization? confidence?)
- Find "somewhat disappointed" users who share the same need
- Build features that convert them to "very disappointed"

### 1.4 The Hooked Model (Nir Eyal)
Build habit-forming product loops:

| Component | Coreline Application |
|-----------|---------------------|
| **Trigger** | Email reminder: "You have an interview tomorrow" / "5 jobs expiring soon" |
| **Action** | Open app, check job status |
| **Variable Reward** | New job matches, interview request notifications, progress metrics |
| **Investment** | Add notes, save jobs, customize boards |

### 1.5 ICE Framework (for Prioritizing Marketing Experiments)
Score each marketing initiative:
- **Impact:** How much will this move the needle?
- **Confidence:** How sure are we it'll work?
- **Ease:** How fast/cheap can we test it?

Score each 1-10, prioritize by total score.

## Appendix: Job Seeker Psychology

### The Emotional Journey of Job Searching

```
Hope → Application → Waiting → Anxiety → Rejection/Ghosting → 
Frustration → Doubt → Renewed Effort → (Repeat) → OFFER → Relief/Joy
```

**Key Psychological Insights:**

1. **Loss of Control:** Job searching feels chaotic. Offer structure.
2. **Rejection Sensitivity:** Constant rejection hurts. Celebrate small wins.
3. **Time Distortion:** "It's been forever" vs. reality. Show progress data.
4. **Comparison Trap:** Others seem to have it easier. Normalize the struggle.
5. **Imposter Syndrome:** "Am I good enough?" Build confidence.
6. **Decision Fatigue:** Too many choices. Simplify.

**How Coreline Can Help:**
- Visualize progress (you've done more than you think)
- Celebrate milestones (first interview, 10 applications)
- Provide structure (reduce cognitive load)
- Normalize timeline (average search takes X weeks)
- Community support (you're not alone)
