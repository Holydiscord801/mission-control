# CoreLine Launch Plan — 500 Users in 30 Days
## The Warpath

**Date:** January 27, 2026  
**Target:** 500 paying users by end of Month 1, 1,000 by Month 2  
**MRR Goal:** $7,500 Month 1 → $15,000 Month 2

---

## Why 500 is Possible

1. **Market is HOT** — layoffs everywhere, people desperate and willing to pay
2. **Price advantage is massive** — $14.95 vs Huntr's $40 (63% cheaper)
3. **Product Hunt alone can deliver 1000+ signups** if we hit top 5
4. **Bot Dog at scale** — 50/day × 30 days = 1,500 direct touches
5. **The "you know 3 people here" moment** — if it lands, people share it
6. **Micah's story is GOLD** — authentic, vulnerable, relatable
